# 🌟 Overview

**Raksha Setu (रक्षा सेतु)** is a modern Android application designed to digitize and secure visitor management in residential societies, gated communities, and apartments.

The name **Raksha Setu** means **"Bridge of Protection"**, representing a secure digital connection between:

- Residents 🏠  
- Watchmen 🛡️  
- Society Management 👑  

This app replaces traditional manual registers with a **secure, real-time, digital system** that provides visitor verification, instant notifications, and complete transparency.

---

# ❗ Problem Statement

Traditional society visitor management faces serious security and operational issues:

| Problem | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Manual Registers | Data loss, illegible entries |
| No Real-time Alerts | Residents unaware of visitors |
| No Photo Records | No identity verification |
| Unauthorized Entry | Major security risk |
| No Central Database | No visitor history tracking |
| No Emergency Alerts | Slow emergency response |
| Communication Gap | Poor coordination |

---

# 💡 Proposed Solution

Raksha Setu provides a **complete digital visitor security system**.

### Workflow:

1. Watchman registers visitor with photo
2. Resident receives instant notification
3. Resident can Allow / Deny / Leave at Gate
4. Watchman receives decision instantly
5. Entry is securely controlled and logged
